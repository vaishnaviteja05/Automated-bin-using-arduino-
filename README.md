# 🗑️ Automated Bin using Arduino

## Overview

The **Automated Bin** is a smart, hands-free waste disposal system that opens its lid automatically when it detects nearby motion. This reduces contact, improves hygiene, and makes waste disposal more convenient for homes, offices, and public spaces.

---

## Features

* Automatic lid opening when an object is detected
* Touchless operation for better hygiene
* Compact and easy to install
* Energy-efficient design

---

## 📂 Installation

### 1️⃣ Assemble the Hardware

* Arduino Uno or compatible board
* Servo motor for lid movement
* Ultrasonic or IR sensor for motion detection
* Jumper wires and breadboard
* Power supply (USB or battery)
* Bin with lid

### 2️⃣ Setup Arduino IDE

* Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* Open your project folder in Arduino IDE
* Select your board type and COM port

### 3️⃣ Upload the Program

* Upload the Arduino program to the board
* Power the system and test the bin

---

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Place the bin in the desired location.
2. When an object comes near, the lid opens automatically.
3. The lid closes after a short delay if no object is detected.
